# Basic Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of basic machine learning projects! This repository includes implementations of core machine learning models, with **Jupyter Notebooks** used for interactive exploration and visualization, and **Python scripts** for production-ready code.

## Projects Included

1. **House Price Prediction**
   - **Notebook**: `house_price_prediction.ipynb`
   - **Script**: `house_price_prediction.py`
   - **Description**: A regression model to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, etc.
   - **Techniques**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
   - **Libraries Used**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.

## Structure

- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**: Used for interactive data exploration, visualization, and step-by-step explanation of the ML process. These notebooks are ideal for learning and demonstration purposes.
  
- **Python Scripts (`.py`)**: Production-ready code that implements the core logic of each project. These scripts are optimized for performance and are suitable for integration into larger systems or automation pipelines.

## Getting Started

To explore or run the projects, follow these steps:

### Running the Notebooks:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-projects.git
   cd ml-projects
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   
### Running the Scripts:
1. You can run the .py files directly using
   ```bash
   python project_name.py
   
### Note:
For projects with both a notebook and a script, you can explore the logic in the notebook and run the script for more optimized code.

### Dependencies
The following libraries are used across the projects:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for .ipynb files)
