# Basic Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of basic machine learning projects! This repository includes implementations of core machine learning models, with **Jupyter Notebooks** used for interactive exploration and visualization, and **Python scripts** for production-ready code.

## Projects Included

1. **House Price Prediction**
   - **Notebook**: `house_price_prediction.ipynb`
   - **Script**: `house_price_prediction.py`
   - **Description**: A regression model to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, etc.
   - **Techniques**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
   - **Libraries Used**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.

2. **[Add Other Projects]**
   - **Notebook**: `[project_name].ipynb`
   - **Script**: `[project_name].py`
   - **Description**: Brief explanation of each project.
   - **Techniques**: Mention key ML techniques used.
   - **Libraries Used**: Mention major libraries.

## Structure

- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)**: Used for interactive data exploration, visualization, and step-by-step explanation of the ML process. These notebooks are ideal for learning and demonstration purposes.
  
- **Python Scripts (`.py`)**: Production-ready code that implements the core logic of each project. These scripts are optimized for performance and are suitable for integration into larger systems or automation pipelines.

## Getting Started

To explore or run the projects, follow these steps:

### Running the Notebooks:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-projects.git
   cd ml-projects
